It is the big park in and around korattur it is located near korattur railway station. The park is not properly maintained by government only they have planted some trees and kept some sodium lights but no play things for childrens and the foot path tiles were not placed properlt in many places it is broken and some of the tiles is coming out when you walk on that. And one more thing full of misquotes you can't walk and sit in that park after 6 30pm. Park needs to be maintained properly., https://indiapl.com/tamil-nadu/korattur-public-park-232301
