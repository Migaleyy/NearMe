It is four years since the Korattur terminus was renovated, and residents are still waiting to see an adequate number of services being operated to other neighbourhoods. Broadway, T. Nagar and Thiruvanmiyur are among the areas that commuters want to see bus services being operated to. 
To give a picture of how difficult it is for commuters now, to go to CMBT, Koyambedu, Tambaram, Anna Salai, Perambur, Red Hills and Poonamallee, they have to board a minimum of two buses. 
Currently, only a few bus services, mostly to Broadway (7B, S7B, 07B and 0S7B and M47D (Extension)), T. Nagar and 23C Extension to Thiruvanmiyur, are being operated from the terminus. Therefore, commuters rely on share-autos and maxi cabs to reach key stretches such as J.N. Main Road where many buses are available. 
“The terminus is the only public transport facility in the neighbourhood. More services and new routes should be introduced to benefit commuters,” says K. Ashok, a commuter from Korattur.
